It ingests data from various source systems using multiple patterns (batch, real-time, stream, event), processes and stores it in a centralized data hub, and applies rigorous data management and governance before consumption by analytics and reporting tools.\n\n**Description**\nThe system design illustrates a modern, layered data architecture. It begins with \"Source Systems\" like core banking and AML, which feed data into a \"Data Integration\" layer using appropriate methods such as SFTP for batch, services for real-time, and engines for streams. An event-driven path using an \"Enterprise Eventing Platform\" and \"Message Broker\" is also present. Data lands in an \"Enterprise Data Hub\" comprising a warehouse, data lake, lakehouse, and customer vault. This hub is governed by \"Data Management\" tools (MDM, DQ, Masking) and a \"Data Governance\" layer that handles metadata, lineage, and catalogs. Finally, the curated data is consumed by an \"Analytics\" layer for BI and regulatory reporting, ensuring a controlled, high-quality data flow from source to insight.\n\n**Applications**\n- Title: Retail Core Banking System\n- System Code: APP001\n- Group: Source Systems\n- Relationships:\n  -

Centralized governance (APP061) allows for consistent policy enforcement.\n- Integration Complexity: The architecture effectively manages complexity by using dedicated integration patterns and services. This prevents a \"point-to-point\" mess and standardizes how data flows between layers.\n\n**Cons**\n- Scalability: The batch-based integration from the Retail Core Banking System (APP001) is a potential performance bottleneck and does not scale well for near-real-time analytical requirements.\n- Integration Complexity: The high number of specialized components (17+) and their API-based interconnections create a complex dependency graph. Changes in one component, like the MDM, can have ripple effects on many others.\n- Maintainability: The large number of systems increases operational overhead, monitoring complexity, and the need for diverse technical skill sets. A failure in a central component like the Data Lake (APP046) could halt multiple downstream processes.\n- Security: Centralized data repositories like the Data Lake and Data Warehouse are high-value targets for security threats, requiring robust and complex access control management across all integrated systems.\n\n**Class Diagram (Mermaid)**\n```classDiagram\n    class APP001 {\n
