It uses an event-driven approach for decoupling core domains like Party Lifecycle, CRM, and Onboarding, facilitating asynchronous processing and real-time data integration.\n\n**Description**\nThe system is a domain-driven architecture for a financial institution, organized into logical groups like Digital Channels, Integration, Customer Onboarding, and CRM. Customer interactions from portals and apps are routed through a central API Gateway. This gateway directs requests to systems like the Digital Onboarding Platform and also feeds an Enterprise Eventing Platform. The eventing platform decouples systems, broadcasting events to consumers like the Party Lifecycle Management and Automated Outreach Platform. Core data systems such as Party Lifecycle and Global Customer ID Registry act as sources of truth, propagating updates via events to CRM and Compliance platforms. This hybrid approach, combining synchronous APIs for immediate requests and asynchronous events for system-wide updates, creates a responsive and scalable ecosystem. The architecture extends to customer engagement with AI-driven bots fed by a dedicated engagement platform.\n\n**Applications**\n- Title: Private Banking Client Portal\n- System Code: APP018\n- Group: Digital Channels\n- Relationships:\n  -
