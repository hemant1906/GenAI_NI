It connects digital front-ends to backend domains like lending, core banking, and compliance through a central integration layer. The design incorporates modern capabilities like AI-powered underwriting and explores blockchain for trade finance.\n\n**Description**\nThe architecture depicts a modern banking ecosystem designed for modularity and scalability. Customer interactions originating from Digital Channels are managed through a central API Gateway, which routes requests to the appropriate backend systems. The system is logically grouped into functional domains such as Business Lending, Trade Finance, Core Banking, and Customer Management. A key feature is the hybrid integration strategy, employing synchronous APIs for real-time requests and an Enterprise Eventing Platform for asynchronous communication and decoupling of services. This is particularly evident in the Compliance and Risk Management domains, where events trigger processes like KYC, AML monitoring, and credit checks. The architecture supports innovation by isolating new technologies like an AI-Powered Loan Underwriting engine and a Blockchain POC, minimizing risk to core systems. The Real-time Data Integration Service further enhances capabilities by enabling timely data synchronization between critical platforms.\n\n**Applications**\n- Title: Private Banking Client Portal\n- System Code: APP018\n- Group: Digital Channels\n- Relationships:\n  -

A security breach at this single entry point could potentially expose numerous backend systems."
