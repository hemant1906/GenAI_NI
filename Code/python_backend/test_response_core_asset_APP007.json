It uses an API-led and event-driven approach, integrating customer-facing channels with core banking, compliance, and AI-powered risk assessment services through a central integration layer and a dedicated loan origination platform.\n\n**Description**\nThe system enables home loan applications via digital channels like the Online Banking Portal (APP002) and Mobile App (APP003). These channels communicate through an API Gateway (APP040) to the core Home Loan Origination Platform (APP006). This platform orchestrates the entire workflow, interacting with various backend services. It uses an AI-powered service (APP106) for origination, a Digital Signature Service (APP079), and sends events for compliance checks like AML monitoring (APP022) and sanctions screening (APP023). It integrates with the Retail Core Banking System (APP001) for financial data and the Customer 360 View (APP055) for customer information. Credit assessment is handled by an AI-powered service (APP093) which leverages data from a Credit Bureau (APP120). The architecture relies on both synchronous APIs and asynchronous events for communication.\n\n**Applications**\n- Title: Online Banking Portal\n- System Code: APP002\n- Group: Digital Channels\n- Relationships:\n  -
