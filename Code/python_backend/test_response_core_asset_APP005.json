It ingests customer data, performs due diligence, and uses event-driven monitoring and risk analysis to identify suspicious activities. These events are aggregated for case management and regulatory reporting, forming a complete process from onboarding to compliance oversight.\n\n**Description**\nThe system architecture outlines a financial crime and compliance process flow. It begins by sourcing customer data from multiple systems (APP055, APP072, APP092), funneling it into a central KYC/CDD Platform (APP024) via APIs and an eventing platform. This platform orchestrates due diligence, leveraging an external identity service (APP130) and triggering Enhanced Due Diligence (APP026). Events from these platforms drive various downstream processes. The Monitoring group (AML, Sanctions, Fraud) and Risk Management group (UBA, Transaction Monitoring) analyze activities and behaviors. All relevant events, including those from Customer Data Privacy (APP083), converge at the Financial Crime Case Management system (APP027). This central hub manages cases and integrates with a Regulatory Change Management system (APP113). Finally, the Compliance group handles regulatory reporting through a dedicated data hub and platform. The architecture uses a mix of API, event-driven, batch, and real-time integration patterns.\n\n**Applications**\n- Title: Customer 360 View Application\n- System Code: APP055\n- Group: Customer Data Sources\n- Relationships:\n  -

Decouples systems. |\n| AML Transaction Monitoring (APP022) | Medium | Integrates with multiple up and downstream systems, core to monitoring. |\n| Enhanced Due Diligence (APP026) | Medium | Complex logic and integration with multiple sources (batch and event). |\n| All other components | Low | Perform specific functions with limited, well-defined integrations. |\n\n**Pros**\n- Scalability: The architecture is modular and uses an eventing platform, allowing individual components like Monitoring or Risk Management to be scaled independently to handle varying loads.\n- Maintainability: Systems are grouped into logical domains (e.g., \"Monitoring\", \"Risk Management\"), which promotes separation of concerns. This makes it easier to update, replace, or troubleshoot individual applications without impacting the entire ecosystem.\n- Security: Dedicated systems for Sanctions Screening (APP023) and Fraud Detection (APP025) centralize and enforce specific security controls. The modular design can also limit the blast radius of a potential compromise in one component.\n- Integration Complexity: The use of dedicated integration platforms (Eventing, Batch, Real-time) provides a standardized way for systems to communicate, which is more manageable than a mesh of point-to-point connections.\n\n**Cons**\n- Scalability: The KYC/CDD Platform (APP024) and the Case Management system (APP027) are central hubs. A failure or performance degradation in these components could create a bottleneck for the entire workflow.\n- Maintainability: The high number of distinct applications and integration points creates significant operational overhead. Troubleshooting issues may be complex as it requires tracing data flows across multiple systems and communication patterns.\n- Security: The architecture relies on an external Identity Proofing service (APP130), introducing a third-party dependency and risk. The distribution of data across numerous systems increases the overall attack surface.\n- Integration Complexity: The mix of communication styles (API, Event, Batch, Real-time) adds complexity to development, testing, and operational monitoring. There is a high degree of coupling, and changes in core systems can have wide-ranging downstream impacts."
