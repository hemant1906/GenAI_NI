It ingests data from source systems via multiple patterns (batch, real-time, streaming, event-driven), processes it through dedicated integration, storage, and governance layers, and serves it to analytics and reporting applications, ensuring a structured and controlled data flow.\n\n**Description**\nThe system depicts a layered data architecture designed for a large enterprise. It begins with \"Source Systems\" like core banking and AML, which feed data into the platform. The \"Data Integration\" layer uses specific components for each ingestion pattern: SFTP for batch, a service for real-time, and a processing engine for streams. An \"Integration\" layer handles event-driven data from the Credit Card system via an eventing platform and message broker. Data is consolidated in the \"Enterprise Data Hub,\" which includes a Warehouse, Data Lake, Lakehouse, and a Customer Data Vault. Downstream, \"Data Management\" and \"Data Governance\" layers apply MDM, quality, masking, lineage, and cataloging rules. Finally, the \"Analytics\" layer, comprising a BI platform and a Regulatory Reporting Hub, consumes this governed data via APIs to provide business insights and meet compliance requirements.\n\n**Applications**\n- Title: Retail Core Banking System\n- System Code: APP001\n- Group: Source Systems\n- Relationships:\n  -

Managing, monitoring, and ensuring consistency across all data paths is challenging.\n- Maintainability: The architecture requires a broad range of specialized skill sets to manage the diverse technologies. A failure in a central component, like MDM (APP048) or the Data Lakehouse (APP047), can have a widespread, cascading impact.\n- Security: The numerous components and connections increase the overall attack surface. A security vulnerability in any single component could potentially expose data if isolation and defense-in-depth are not rigorously implemented."
