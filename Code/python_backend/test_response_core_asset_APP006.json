It orchestrates investigation, automation, and regulatory reporting through integrated tools and platforms, utilizing a mix of API, event-driven, and batch communication patterns.\n\n**Description**\nThe architecture is a hub-and-spoke model centered on the Financial Crime Case Management system (APP027). This central system receives data through various channels: events from multiple detection systems (AML, Fraud, Sanctions), API calls from customer data applications, and files from external interfaces. It orchestrates responses by triggering a SOAR platform (APP090) via API and archiving data via batch processes. Investigation is supported by integrations with a Threat Intelligence Platform (APP060) and a SIEM (APP059). The system ensures compliance by feeding data to a Regulatory Reporting Hub (APP052) and a separate real-time integration service (APP105). An underlying eventing platform (APP042) facilitates decoupled communication for logging and other integration services, completing the financial crime lifecycle from detection to reporting.\n\n**Applications**\n- Title: AML Transaction Monitoring System\n- System Code: APP022\n- Group: Detection Systems\n- Relationships:\n  -

While simplifying point-to-point connections, its health is critical for multiple downstream processes like logging and automation. |\n| Regulatory Reporting Data Hub (APP052) | Medium | Aggregates data from security tools for a critical business function (compliance). Errors or delays here have significant business and legal impact. |\n| Threat Intelligence Platform (APP060) | Medium | Integrates with the core case management system using three different patterns (API, Event, Batch), adding integration complexity for investigation workflows. |\n\n**Pros**\n- Scalability: The use of distinct detection systems and an event-driven integration platform allows for new data sources to be added with relatively low impact on the existing architecture, promoting horizontal scaling of detection capabilities.\n- Maintainability: Functionally grouping applications (e.g., Detection, Customer Data, Compliance) creates clear domains and ownership boundaries, which simplifies maintenance and upgrades within each vertical.\n- Security: The architecture includes dedicated security components like a SIEM and SOAR platform, enabling centralized security monitoring and automated response, which are strong security postures.\n- Integration Complexity: A central Case Management system provides a standardized target for new data sources. The dedicated Enterprise Eventing Platform offers a decoupled, asynchronous integration pattern that reduces tight coupling for specific workflows like logging.\n\n**Cons**\n- Scalability: The Financial Crime Case Management system (APP027) is a central hub that represents a significant performance bottleneck and a single point of failure. An outage or performance degradation in this system would halt the entire financial crime processing pipeline.\n- Integration Complexity: The architecture relies on a mix of integration styles (File, API, Event, Batch, Real-time) all converging on a single application (APP027). This diversity increases the technical skill set required to maintain the system and complicates troubleshooting.\n- Maintainability: The high number of direct dependencies on APP027 makes it extremely difficult and risky to modify, upgrade, or replace. Any change to its core interfaces could trigger a cascade of changes across more than a dozen connected systems.\n- Security: The centralized nature of APP027 makes it a high-value target for attackers, as compromising this single system would grant access to the entire ecosystem of financial crime data and control."
