It uses an API Gateway and event-driven patterns to integrate digital channels with backend systems like CRM and MDM. The design focuses on centralizing integration, managing customer data holistically, and providing a unified customer view across different business lines.\n\n**Description**\nThe architecture enables customer interactions through Digital Channels, which communicate via a central API Gateway. This gateway orchestrates interactions with backend systems, acting as a single entry point. It leverages an Enterprise Eventing Platform for asynchronous communication, feeding into a Real-time Data Integration Service. The Customer & Party Management domain provides a unified customer view through the Customer 360 application, which is populated by various sources. This consolidated customer data is then fed to specialized CRM systems. A separate Data Hub is responsible for master data management (MDM), data quality, and governance, ensuring data integrity. Identity management is handled by a dedicated CIAM solution. This modular, service-oriented design separates concerns effectively across different business and technical domains.\n\n**Applications**\n- Title: Customer Identity access management CIAM\n- System Code: APP039\n- Group: Identity Management\n- Relationships:\n  - Provides authentication services via an API to the Biometric Authentication Service (APP097).\n\n- Title: Biometric Authentication Service\n- System Code: APP097\n- Group: Identity Management\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives an API call from the CIAM (APP039) to perform biometric authentication.\n\n- Title: Online Banking Portal\n- System Code: APP002\n- Group: Digital Channels\n- Relationships:\n  - Makes API calls to the API Gateway (APP040) to access backend services.\n\n- Title: Mobile Banking App\n- System Code: APP003\n- Group: Digital Channels\n- Relationships:\n  - Makes API calls to the API Gateway (APP040) to access backend services.\n\n- Title: Private Banking Client Portal\n- System Code: APP018\n- Group: Digital Channels\n- Relationships:\n  - Makes API calls to the API Gateway (APP040) to access backend services.\n\n- Title: API Gateway\n- System Code: APP040\n- Group: Integration\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives API calls from all Digital Channels (APP002, APP003, APP018).\n  - Sends API calls to the Global Customer ID Registry (APP072) and the Customer 360 View Application (APP055).\n  - Publishes events to the Enterprise Eventing Platform (APP042).\n\n- Title: Enterprise Eventing Platform\n- System Code: APP042\n- Group: Integration\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives events from the API Gateway (APP040).\n  - Sends events to the Real-time Data Integration Service (APP105).\n\n- Title: Real-time Data Integration Service\n- System Code: APP105\n- Group: Integration\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives events from the Enterprise Eventing Platform (APP042).\n  - Sends real-time data updates to the Customer 360 View Application (APP055).\n\n- Title: Global Customer ID Registry\n- System Code: APP072\n- Group: Customer & Party Management\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives API calls from the API Gateway (APP040).\n  - Sends customer ID data via API to the Master Data Management MDM (APP048).\n\n- Title: Customer 360 View Application\n- System Code: APP055\n- Group: Customer & Party Management\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives API calls from the API Gateway (APP040).\n  - Receives real-time data from the Real-time Data Integration Service (APP105).\n  - Sends events to the Customer data platform CDP (APP092).\n\n- Title: Customer data platform CDP\n- System Code: APP092\n- Group: Customer & Party Management\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives events from the Customer 360 View Application (APP055).\n  - Provides data via API to the CRM - Retail & Personal Banking (APP007) and the CRM - Business & Private Banking (APP019).\n\n- Title: CRM - Retail & Personal Banking\n- System Code: APP007\n- Group: CRM & Relationship\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives customer data via an API call from the Customer data platform CDP (APP092).\n\n- Title: CRM - Business & Private Banking\n- System Code: APP019\n- Group: CRM & Relationship\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives customer data via an API call from the Customer data platform CDP (APP092).\n\n- Title: Master Data Management MDM\n- System Code: APP048\n- Group: Data hub\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives data via an API call from the Global Customer ID Registry (APP072).\n  - Sends data in a batch process to the Data Quality Management Tool (APP049).\n\n- Title: Data Quality Management Tool\n- System Code: APP049\n- Group: Data hub\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives data in a batch from the Master Data Management MDM (APP048).\n  - Sends events to the Enterprise Data Governance Tool (APP061).\n\n- Title: Enterprise Data Governance Tool\n- System Code: APP061\n- Group: Data hub\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives events from the Data Quality Management Tool (APP049).\n\n**System Complexity Table**\n| Component | Complexity | Reason |\n|---|---|---|\n| API Gateway (APP040) | High | Central integration point for all channels; critical path dependency. |\n| Customer 360 View App (APP055) | High | Aggregates data from multiple real-time and API sources to create a unified view. |\n| Master Data Management MDM (APP048)| High | Core system of record for customer data; complex data mastering and stewardship rules. |\n| Enterprise Eventing Platform (APP042)| Medium | Decouples systems but adds operational complexity for managing events, schemas, and reliability. |\n| Digital Channels (APP002, etc.) | Low | Primarily presentation layers with a single, well-defined integration point. |\n\n**Pros**\n- Scalability: The use of an API Gateway and an eventing platform allows for the independent scaling of services. Decoupling producers and consumers of data prevents back-pressure on front-end systems.\n- Maintainability: The architecture is modular with clear separation of concerns (e.g., Identity, Integration, Data Hub). This allows different teams to develop, deploy, and maintain components independently.\n- Security: Centralizing access through the API Gateway (APP040) allows for consistent enforcement of security policies, authentication, and logging. A dedicated CIAM (APP039) further strengthens identity management.\n- Integration Complexity: The API-led approach simplifies how channel applications connect to the backend. The API Gateway acts as a facade, hiding the complexity of the downstream systems from the client applications.\n\n**Cons**\n- Scalability: The API Gateway (APP040) and the Customer 360 View Application (APP055) are potential performance bottlenecks and single points of failure that must be designed for high availability.\n- Integration Complexity: While patterns are used, the high number of components creates a complex web of dependencies. Managing API and event schema versioning, contracts, and observability across the ecosystem requires strong governance.\n- Maintainability: Debugging issues in the event-driven flows can be complex, as it requires tracing events across multiple systems (API Gateway, Eventing Platform, Real-time Service). The centrality of the API Gateway can make major architectural changes difficult.\n- Security: The API Gateway is a high-value target for attackers. A security breach at this layer could potentially expose numerous backend systems and sensitive data."
