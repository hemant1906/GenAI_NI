It ingests data from various core banking systems, processes it in real-time and through events, screens it against sanctions lists and rules, and routes alerts to case management, reporting, and security monitoring platforms.\n\n**Description**\nThe system is designed for financial crime detection, processing transactions from multiple sources like payment hubs and core banking systems. An integration layer, featuring an eventing platform and a data stream processor, standardizes and routes this data. The Sanctions Screening Engine is a central component, enriched by customer and rules data, that analyzes transactions in real-time. Alerts and events are sent to an AML monitoring system, a case management tool for investigation, and a SIEM for security oversight. A separate batch process handles global sanctions screening. The architecture culminates in regulatory reporting and threat intelligence analysis, creating a comprehensive monitoring and response framework.\n\n**Applications**\n- Title: Real-time Payment Hub\n- System Code: APP078\n- Group: Transaction Sources\n- Relationships:\n  -

The overall system complexity may obscure potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations."
