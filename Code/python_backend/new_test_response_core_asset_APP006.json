It ingests events, files, and API data from various detection and customer systems to facilitate investigation, security orchestration, and regulatory reporting, using a dedicated integration layer for eventing and logging.\n\n**Description**\nThis architecture depicts a hub-and-spoke model for managing financial crime compliance. At its core is the Financial Crime Case Management system (APP027), which acts as the central aggregator and workflow engine. It receives alerts and data from multiple upstream sources, including Detection Systems (e.g., AML, Fraud), Customer Data platforms (e.g., KYC, Customer 360), and external interfaces.\n\nData ingestion occurs through various patterns: event-driven alerts, API calls for real-time data, and file/batch transfers for bulk data. Once a case is created, the platform orchestrates investigation activities by integrating with a SOAR for automated responses and a Threat Intelligence Platform.\n\nDownstream, the system feeds data into a Historical Archive, a SIEM for security monitoring, and a Regulatory Reporting Hub. The architecture is supported by a dedicated Integration layer that provides enterprise eventing, centralized logging, and a real-time data feedback loop, ensuring modularity and auditability across the ecosystem.\n\n**Applications**\n- Title: Secure File Transfer Protocol SFTP\n- System Code: APP095\n- Group: External Interfaces\n- Relationships:\n  -

This modularity can simplify maintenance and upgrades for individual components.\n- Security: A robust security posture is evident with dedicated components for threat intelligence (APP060), event management (APP059), and automated response (APP090). The Centralized Audit Logging Service (APP111) provides a comprehensive audit trail.\n- Integration Complexity: The architecture supports a variety of integration patterns (Event, API, Batch, File), providing the flexibility needed to connect with both modern and legacy systems effectively.\n\n**Cons**\n- Scalability: The Financial Crime Case Management system (APP027) is a central hub and a potential performance bottleneck. The entire system's throughput is limited by this single component's ability to process a high volume of concurrent requests and events.\n- Maintainability: The high number of direct, point-to-point connections into the central Case Management system (APP027) creates a high degree of coupling. This makes changes to the central system risky and complex, as it has a wide blast radius affecting numerous other systems.\n- Security: The central case management system (APP027) aggregates all sensitive financial crime data, making it an extremely high-value target for attackers. A breach of this single system could lead to a catastrophic data loss.\n- Integration Complexity: The mix of integration styles (direct API/batch vs. event bus) directed at the central hub (APP027) creates inconsistency. This can increase the cognitive load for development teams and complicate governance and error handling. The unlabeled data flows suggest potential for undocumented integrations.\n\n**Class Diagram (Mermaid)**\n```classDiagram\n    class APP095 {\n        protocolType\n        host\n
