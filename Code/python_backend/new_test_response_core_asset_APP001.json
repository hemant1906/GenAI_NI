It uses an API Gateway to serve digital channels and an event-driven integration layer to feed a central Customer 360 view. Data quality and governance are managed through a dedicated Data Hub, which supports specialized CRM systems.\n\n**Description**\nThe system is designed around a clear separation of concerns. Customer-facing digital channels interact with the backend via a central API Gateway. This gateway routes requests and publishes events to an Enterprise Eventing Platform, enabling asynchronous processing. Real-time data integration services consume these events to enrich a Customer 360 View application. Core customer identity is handled by a dedicated CIAM solution.\n\nThe Customer 360 view informs a Customer Data Platform (CDP), which in turn feeds segmented data to specialized CRMs for Retail and Business banking. A separate Data Hub is responsible for Master Data Management (MDM), Data Quality, and Data Governance, ensuring data integrity across the enterprise through batch and event-based processes. This modular, event-driven approach supports scalability and maintainability.\n\n**Applications**\n- Title: Customer Identity access management CIAM\n- System Code: APP039\n- Group: Identity Management\n- Relationships:\n  - Sends API requests to the Biometric Authentication Service (APP097) to perform biometric checks.\n\n- Title: Biometric Authentication Service\n- System Code: APP097\n- Group: Identity Management\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives API requests from the Customer Identity access management CIAM (APP039) to validate biometric data.\n\n- Title: Online Banking Portal\n- System Code: APP002\n- Group: Digital Channels\n- Relationships:\n  - Communicates with backend services via the API Gateway (APP040) using API calls.\n\n- Title: Mobile Banking App\n- System Code: APP003\n- Group: Digital Channels\n- Relationships:\n  - Communicates with backend services via the API Gateway (APP040) using API calls.\n\n- Title: Private Banking Client Portal\n- System Code: APP018\n- Group: Digital Channels\n- Relationships:\n  - Communicates with backend services via the API Gateway (APP040) using API calls.\n\n- Title: API Gateway\n- System Code: APP040\n- Group: Integration\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives API requests from the Online Banking Portal (APP002), Mobile Banking App (APP003), and Private Banking Client Portal (APP018).\n  - Sends API requests to the Global Customer ID Registry (APP072) for identity lookups.\n  - Sends API requests to the Customer 360 View Application (APP055) to fetch consolidated customer data.\n  - Publishes events to the Enterprise Eventing Platform (APP042) to trigger asynchronous workflows.\n\n- Title: Enterprise Eventing Platform\n- System Code: APP042\n- Group: Integration\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives events from the API Gateway (APP040).\n  - Pushes events to the Real-time Data Integration Service (APP105) for processing.\n\n- Title: Real-time Data Integration Service\n- System Code: APP105\n- Group: Integration\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives events from the Enterprise Eventing Platform (APP042).\n  - Sends real-time data updates to the Customer 360 View Application (APP055).\n\n- Title: Global Customer ID Registry\n- System Code: APP072\n- Group: Customer & Party Management\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives API requests from the API Gateway (APP040).\n  - Sends API requests to the Master Data Management MDM (APP048) to synchronize customer identity data.\n\n- Title: Customer 360 View Application\n- System Code: APP055\n- Group: Customer & Party Management\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives API requests from the API Gateway (APP040).\n  - Receives real-time data updates from the Real-time Data Integration Service (APP105).\n  - Publishes events to the Customer data platform CDP (APP092) when customer profiles are updated.\n\n- Title: Customer data platform CDP\n- System Code: APP092\n- Group: Customer & Party Management\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives events from the Customer 360 View Application (APP055).\n  - Sends customer data via API to the CRM - Retail & Personal Banking (APP007).\n  - Sends customer data via API to the CRM - Business & Private Banking (APP019).\n\n- Title: CRM - Retail & Personal Banking\n- System Code: APP007\n- Group: CRM & Relationship\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives API-based data feeds from the Customer data platform CDP (APP092).\n\n- Title: CRM - Business & Private Banking\n- System Code: APP019\n- Group: CRM & Relationship\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives API-based data feeds from the Customer data platform CDP (APP092).\n\n- Title: Master Data Management MDM\n- System Code: APP048\n- Group: Data hub\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives API requests from the Global Customer ID Registry (APP072).\n  - Sends data via batch processes to the Data Quality Management Tool (APP049).\n\n- Title: Data Quality Management Tool\n- System Code: APP049\n- Group: Data hub\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives batch data from the Master Data Management MDM (APP048).\n  - Publishes data quality events to the Enterprise Data Governance Tool (APP061).\n\n- Title: Enterprise Data Governance Tool\n- System Code: APP061\n- Group: Data hub\n- Relationships:\n  - Receives events from the Data Quality Management Tool (APP049).\n\n**System Complexity Table**\n| Component | Complexity | Reason |\n|---|---|---|\n| API Gateway (APP040) | High | Central integration point for all channels; critical path dependency; single point of failure. |\n| Customer 360 View Application (APP055) | High | Aggregates data from multiple real-time and API sources; complex business logic. |\n| Master Data Management MDM (APP048) | Medium | Manages critical \"golden record\" data; complex consolidation rules and data stewardship workflows. |\n| Enterprise Eventing Platform (APP042) | Medium | Central broker for asynchronous communication; high volume can create performance challenges. |\n| Customer Identity access management (APP039) | Medium | Critical security component with external dependencies (biometrics). |\n| Customer data platform CDP (APP092) | Medium | Involves complex segmentation logic and manages data flows to multiple downstream systems. |\n| Digital Channels (APP002, APP003, etc.) | Low | Act primarily as clients to the API Gateway; complexity is contained within the application itself. |\n\n**Pros**\n- Scalability: The decoupled architecture using an API Gateway and an eventing platform allows individual services to be scaled independently based on demand.\n- Maintainability: Separation of concerns into domains like Identity, Integration, and Data Hub makes it easier to manage, update, or replace components without system-wide disruption.\n- Security: A centralized API Gateway and a dedicated CIAM service provide clear, enforceable points for security controls, authentication, and threat monitoring.\n- Integration Complexity: The use of standardized patterns (API Gateway, Event Bus) prevents a \"spaghetti architecture\" of point-to-point integrations, promoting consistency and reusability.\n\n**Cons**\n- Scalability: The API Gateway and Enterprise Eventing Platform are central components that could become performance bottlenecks if not architected for high availability and elastic scaling.\n- Integration Complexity: The high number of components and data hops in a distributed system can increase latency and make end-to-end troubleshooting and debugging more challenging.\n- Maintainability: Managing a distributed system requires mature observability practices, including centralized logging, metrics, and distributed tracing, to maintain operational visibility.\n- Security: The API Gateway is a high-value target for attackers. A compromise of this single entry point could potentially expose numerous backend services.\n\n**Class Diagram (Mermaid)**\n```classDiagram\n    class Ciam {\n        tenantId\n        userDirectory\n
