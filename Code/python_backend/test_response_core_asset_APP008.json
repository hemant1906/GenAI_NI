It employs a hybrid integration model with an API Gateway for synchronous requests from digital channels and an event-driven pattern for asynchronous communication between backend systems like Core Banking, Compliance, and Customer Management.\n\n**Description**\nThe architecture is organized into logical business domains, such as Digital Channels, Core Banking, and Customer Management. It utilizes a centralized Integration layer featuring an API Gateway (APP040) and an Enterprise Eventing Platform (APP042). Digital channels interact with backend services via the API Gateway. The Retail Core Banking system (APP001) acts as a central hub, propagating data changes as events to downstream systems. These events are consumed by Compliance for AML monitoring, by Customer Management to build a 360-degree view, and by Analytics for segmentation. This hybrid API and event-driven approach enables both real-time request-response interactions and decoupled, asynchronous data flows, supporting a wide range of banking operations from transactions to customer outreach.\n\n**Applications**\n- Title: Online Banking Portal\n- System Code: APP002\n- Group: Digital Channels\n- Relationships:\n  -

This makes it easier to add new applications that need to react to business events (like a new transaction) without modifying existing systems.\n\n**Cons**\n- Scalability: The Retail Core Banking System (APP001) appears to be a monolithic component that is highly interconnected. It may become a performance and scalability bottleneck for the entire architecture.\n- Integration Complexity: The mix of integration styles (API, Event, Real-time) can increase the overall complexity of governance, monitoring, and debugging end-to-end processes. The API Gateway (APP040) represents a single point of failure.\n- Security: The API Gateway (APP040) is a critical asset and an attractive target for attackers. A compromise of the gateway could potentially expose a wide range of backend services.\n- Maintainability: While domains are separate, the web of connections through the central integration and core banking systems can make troubleshooting data flow and dependency issues complex."
