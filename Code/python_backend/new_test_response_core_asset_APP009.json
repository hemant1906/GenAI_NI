It leverages an API Gateway for synchronous requests, an eventing platform for asynchronous communication, and a real-time service for data synchronization. Functional domains like lending, compliance, and core banking are clearly delineated, supporting various digital channels.\n\n**Description**\nThe architecture diagram illustrates a modern enterprise banking ecosystem organized into distinct functional domains. Digital Channels, including client portals and onboarding platforms, serve as the primary user-facing entry points. The Integration layer, featuring an API Gateway, an Enterprise Eventing Platform, and a Real-time Data Integration Service, acts as the central nervous system, decoupling producers from consumers. Core capabilities are provided by specialized groups for Business Lending, Core Banking, Trade Finance, and Customer Management. Critical support functions like Compliance (AML, KYC) and Risk Management (Credit Bureau, AI-powered Prediction) are integrated via event-driven and API-based communication. This layered and decoupled approach allows for specialized, modern solutions like AI-powered underwriting and blockchain POCs to coexist with traditional core systems.\n\n**Applications**\n- Title: Private Banking Client Portal\n- System Code: APP018\n- Group: Digital Channels\n- Relationships:\n  -

Systems can be updated or replaced with minimal impact on others.\n- Security: Centralizing access through the API Gateway (APP040) enables consistent enforcement of security policies, authentication, authorization, and rate limiting for a large portion of the architecture.\n- Integration Complexity: While numerous, integrations are managed through a structured hub-and-spoke model (via API Gateway and Event Platform) rather than a complex web of point-to-point connections, which simplifies governance and the addition of new services.\n\n**Cons**\n- Scalability: The central integration components (API Gateway APP040, Real-time Service APP105, Eventing Platform APP042) are potential performance bottlenecks and single points of failure that could impact the entire ecosystem.\n- Integration Complexity: The architecture relies on three different integration styles (API, Event, Real-time), which increases operational complexity, requiring expertise in managing, monitoring, and debugging all three patterns. The high degree of connectivity still requires significant integration effort and testing.\n- Maintainability: Debugging and tracing transactions can be difficult in such a distributed system, especially for processes that flow across API calls and asynchronous events. It requires sophisticated monitoring and observability tools.\n- Security: The centralized integration hubs (especially the API Gateway) are high-value targets for attackers. A compromise of one of these central components could expose a vast number of backend systems.\n\n**Class Diagram (Mermaid)**\n```classDiagram\nclass APP018 {\n    portalUrl\n    activeSessions\n
