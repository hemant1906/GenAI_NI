It uses an API Gateway and an event-driven platform to integrate digital customer channels with core banking, compliance, customer management, and AI-powered risk assessment services, creating a comprehensive, orchestrated workflow for lending.\n\n**Description**\nThe system architecture details a loan origination process initiated through digital channels like the Online Portal (APP002) and Mobile App (APP003). These channels communicate via a central API Gateway (APP040), which directs requests to the Home Loan Origination Platform (APP006). This platform acts as the core orchestrator, integrating with various specialized domains. It pulls customer data via the Customer 360 View (APP055), interacts with the Retail Core Banking System (APP001) for financial data, and uses the Credit Bureau Service (APP120) for risk assessment. The architecture heavily relies on both synchronous API calls for real-time data exchange and asynchronous events for processes like AML monitoring (APP022), document logging (APP111), and customer onboarding (APP011). It also incorporates advanced capabilities like AI-powered credit assessment (APP093) and loan origination assistance (APP106), demonstrating a commitment to automating and enhancing decision-making processes. Compliance is managed through a dedicated stack that includes sanctions screening and regulatory reporting.\n\n**Applications**\n- Title: Online Banking Portal\n- System Code: APP002\n- Group: Digital Channels\n- Relationships:\n  -

Asynchronous processing of compliance and logging tasks enhances resilience and throughput.\n- Maintainability: Clear separation of concerns into domains (e.g., Compliance, Customer Management, Core Banking) promotes modularity. Teams can own and develop services independently, reducing cognitive load and deployment conflicts.\n- Security: Centralizing inbound traffic through an API Gateway (APP040) provides a single point for enforcing security policies like authentication, authorization, and rate limiting, improving the overall security posture.\n- Integration Complexity: The architecture provides flexibility by supporting both synchronous (API) and asynchronous (event-driven) communication patterns, allowing for the selection of the best pattern for each use case (e.g., real-time queries vs. decoupled notifications).\n\n**Cons**\n- Scalability: The Home Loan Origination Platform (APP006) is a central hub and could become a performance bottleneck if it is not designed to be highly scalable and resilient, as it orchestrates a critical, multi-step business process.\n- Integration Complexity: While patterns are in place, the sheer number of connections originating from the Home Loan Origination Platform (APP006) creates a \"star\" or \"hub-and-spoke\" anti-pattern. This tight coupling makes the system complex to test, debug, and evolve.\n- Maintainability: The high number of dependencies on the Home Loan Origination Platform (APP006) makes it difficult to change or replace. A failure in this central component could have cascading effects across the entire loan origination workflow.\n- Security: The API Gateway (APP040) represents a single point of failure and a high-value target for attackers. A compromise of the gateway could potentially expose all connected backend services.\n\n**Class Diagram (Mermaid)**\n```classDiagram\n    class OnlineBankingPortal {\n        portalUrl\n
