It uses a hybrid integration model with an API Gateway for channel interactions and an event-driven core for processes like onboarding, lifecycle management, and CRM. The design emphasizes modularity through distinct business capability domains like Compliance and Customer Service.\n\n**Description**\nThe system architecture is designed around customer interactions originating from Digital Channels (portals and mobile apps). These synchronous requests are managed and secured by an API Gateway, which routes them to downstream services. Key business processes, such as customer onboarding, are handled by dedicated platforms that integrate with an external Identity Proofing service.\n\nCore customer data is managed by a Party Lifecycle Management system, which communicates asynchronously via events with a Global Customer ID Registry and CRM systems. This event-driven approach, powered by an Enterprise Eventing Platform, decouples backend systems, enabling processes like compliance checks (KYC/CDD) and automated customer outreach. CRM and engagement platforms further leverage this data to power AI-driven customer service bots, completing the customer journey.\n\n**Applications**\n- Title: Private Banking Client Portal\n- System Code: APP018\n- Group: Digital Channels\n- Relationships:\n  -

The API Gateway can be scaled to handle varying loads from digital channels.\n- Maintainability: The architecture is broken down into logical business domains, promoting separation of concerns and making individual components easier to manage and update. Decoupling via events reduces the impact of changes.\n- Security: A centralized API Gateway provides a single point of control for enforcing security policies like authentication, authorization, and traffic management for all external-facing services.\n- Integration Complexity: The hybrid integration strategy (API-led and event-driven) offers flexibility. The API Gateway simplifies request-response interactions for frontends, while the eventing platform efficiently manages asynchronous workflows and data synchronization, reducing tight coupling between core systems.\n\n**Cons**\n- Scalability: The API Gateway and the Enterprise Eventing Platform are potential single points of failure. If not designed for high availability and elastic scaling, they can become performance bottlenecks for the entire system.\n- Integration Complexity: The mix of integration patterns (API, Event, Realtime) increases the overall complexity of governance, monitoring, and debugging. Tracing a single business process across multiple asynchronous hops can be challenging. Some point-to-point API integrations exist, which can lead to tight coupling and maintenance overhead.\n- Maintainability: In the event-driven segments, managing event schema evolution, ensuring data consistency across consumers, and handling event ordering or idempotency can become significant maintenance challenges as the system grows.\n- Security: While the API Gateway secures the perimeter, the internal event bus must also be secured to prevent unauthorized data access or event spoofing between services. A breach of a single service could potentially inject malicious events into the ecosystem.\n\n**Class Diagram (Mermaid)**\n```classDiagram\n    class PrivateBankingClientPortal {\n        clientId\n
