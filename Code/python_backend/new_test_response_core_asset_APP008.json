Digital channels communicate via an API Gateway, while backend systems like Core Banking, Compliance, and Analytics are decoupled using an event-driven approach. The system is centered around a Retail Core Banking system and a Customer 360 view.\n\n**Description**\nThe architecture is structured around key business capabilities. Customer-facing \"Digital Channels\" (mobile, web, branch) interact with the system through a central \"API Gateway\". This gateway routes requests to core services and the \"Customer Support\" bot.\n\nThe \"Core Banking\" system is the central hub, processing transactions and managing accounts. It communicates with backend systems primarily through events via an \"Enterprise Eventing Platform\" and a \"Real-time Data Integration Service\". This event-driven pattern connects the core to \"Compliance\" (AML, Fraud), \"Customer Management\" (CRM, 360 View), and \"Analytics\" (Segmentation, CDP). This decoupling allows for asynchronous processing and greater system resilience. Sub-domains like \"Financial Planning\" and \"Customer Loyalty\" are driven by data from the CRM and Customer 360 applications, enabling personalized customer experiences.\n\n**Applications**\n- Title: Retail Core Banking System\n- System Code: APP001\n- Group: Core Banking\n- Relationships:\n  -

Changes to the CRM, for example, have a limited blast radius. Centralized API management via the Gateway simplifies client integrations.\n- Security: The API Gateway provides a single point of control for enforcing security policies (authentication, rate limiting) for all external-facing traffic. Dedicated compliance systems isolate sensitive monitoring logic.\n- Integration Complexity: The hybrid API and event-driven approach provides flexibility. APIs offer a simple request-response model for channels, while events reduce tight coupling between internal, data-intensive systems.\n\n**Cons**\n- Scalability: The Retail Core Banking System (APP001) is a potential monolith and bottleneck. If it cannot scale to handle the load from both API calls and real-time events, the entire architecture's performance will suffer.\n- Integration Complexity: The API Gateway (APP040) is a critical single point of failure. An outage would disable all digital channels. Managing data consistency between synchronous API updates and asynchronous event flows can be very challenging.\n- Maintainability: The high number of dependencies on the Core Banking System means that any changes to its APIs or event structures will have a wide-ranging impact, making it difficult and risky to update or replace.\n- Security: As the primary entry point, the API Gateway is a high-value target for cyberattacks. A compromise of the gateway could potentially expose all connected backend systems.\n\n**Class Diagram (Mermaid)**\n```classDiagram\nclass OnlineBankingPortal {\n    sessionId\n    customerProfile\n
