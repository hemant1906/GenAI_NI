It integrates customer data sources, performs due diligence, and feeds events into monitoring, risk management, and case management systems. The design leverages event-driven, API, and batch patterns for data flow and process orchestration across distinct functional domains.\n\n**Description**\nThe system initiates processes from customer data sources, including a 360 View and a Global ID Registry, which feed a central KYC/CDD Platform via APIs. This platform orchestrates due diligence, leveraging an external identity service and an internal EDD platform. Events from due diligence trigger processes in Monitoring (AML, Sanctions, Fraud) and Risk Management (Loan Default, UBA). All relevant alerts and events from monitoring, risk, and even real-time data feeds are consolidated into a Financial Crime Case Management system. This central case manager then interacts with a Regulatory Change Management system and initiates compliance workflows for data privacy and regulatory reporting, which operate through a dedicated data hub. The architecture relies on a mix of integration styles including event-driven, batch processing, and direct API calls to connect its modular components.\n\n**Applications**\n- Title: Customer 360 View Application\n- System Code: APP055\n- Group: Customer Data Sources\n- Relationships:\n  -

Connects disparate eventing and case systems. |\n| APP052 Regulatory Reporting Data Hub | Medium | Acts as a data aggregation point, mixing batch ingest with API servicing, which can be complex to manage. |\n| APP026 Enhanced Due Diligence EDD Platform | Medium | Sits in a critical path, triggering multiple downstream processes in both monitoring and risk domains. |\n| APP113 Regulatory Change Management System | Low | Simple endpoint system with a single inbound API connection in this view. |\n| APP023 Sanctions Screening Engine | Low | Acts as a simple event consumer from a single source in this architecture. |\n\n**Pros**\n- Scalability: The use of dedicated eventing and integration platforms (APP042, APP105) combined with event-driven communication between domains (e.g., Monitoring to Case Management) allows components to be scaled independently.\n- Maintainability: The architecture is broken down into clear, domain-oriented groups (e.g., Monitoring, Risk Management, Compliance). This modularity simplifies understanding, troubleshooting, and making isolated changes to specific functional areas.\n- Security: The architecture isolates critical security functions into dedicated components, such as the Sanctions Screening Engine (APP023) and the external Identity Proofing Service (APP130), allowing for focused security controls and auditing.\n- Integration Complexity: While complex overall, the use of different, appropriate integration patterns (API for request-reply, Events for decoupling, Batch for large data) shows a mature approach. Centralized integration hubs can reduce the chaos of pure point-to-point connections.\n\n**Cons**\n- Scalability: The KYC/CDD Platform (APP024) is a potential performance bottleneck. As a central hub that interacts synchronously via APIs with data sources, its throughput could limit the scalability of the entire onboarding and due diligence process.\n- Integration Complexity: The mix of integration styles (API, Event, Batch) across the landscape increases the overall operational complexity. It requires sophisticated monitoring to trace a single business process across multiple systems and communication patterns, making error diagnosis challenging.\n- Maintainability: The high number of specialized applications creates significant operational overhead for deployment, patching, and lifecycle management. The long and branched dependency chains mean that a failure in an upstream system like APP024 can have a cascading impact on many downstream services.\n- Security: The extensive connectivity between numerous applications creates a large attack surface. A security breach in a central component like the Case Management system (APP027) or KYC Platform (APP024) could expose sensitive data from multiple domains.\n\n**Class Diagram
