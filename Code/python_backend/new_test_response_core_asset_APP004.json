It ingests transaction data from core banking systems, processes it in real-time and via events, screens it for sanctions and AML risks, and forwards suspicious activities to case management, security monitoring, and regulatory reporting platforms using mixed integration patterns.\n\n**Description**\nThe system is designed to detect and manage financial crime risks. Transaction data from sources like payment hubs and core banking systems (APP078, APP053, APP014, APP001) flows into an integration layer. This layer uses a Data Stream Processing Engine (APP066) and an Enterprise Eventing Platform (APP042) to normalize and route data.\n\nThe core component is the Sanctions Screening Engine (APP023), which analyzes transactions in real-time using data from the Customer ID Registry (APP072) and a rules engine (APP028). A separate batch process (APP100) handles screening against master data (APP048).\n\nAlerts and events are distributed to an AML Monitoring System (APP022), a SIEM (APP059) for security logging, and a Financial Crime Case Management tool (APP027) for investigation. Finally, a reporting hub (APP052) aggregates data for a regulatory compliance platform (APP080). The architecture employs a mix of API, event, stream, and batch integrations.\n\n**Applications**\n- Title: Real-time Payment Hub\n- System Code: APP078\n- Group: Transaction Sources\n- Relationships:\n  -

Multiple direct integrations exist alongside the central platforms, creating a hybrid model that can be difficult to manage.\n- Maintainability: The Sanctions Screening Engine (APP023) is a central component with a high number of dependencies. Any changes or failures in this engine will have a significant ripple effect across the entire ecosystem, making it a high-risk component to modify.\n- Security: The Sanctions Screening Engine (APP023) represents a critical single point of failure and a high-value target. A compromise of this system could disable the organization's primary defense against financial crime.\n\n**Class Diagram (Mermaid)**\n```classDiagram\n    class APP078_RealTimePaymentHub {\n
